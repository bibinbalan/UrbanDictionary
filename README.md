# UrbanDictionary

Android MVP Urban Dictionary

This project demonstrates Model-View-Presenter pattern in android. It is an Urban dictionary app which fetches and dispalys the  meanings of the  word user seach.

Following notable libraries have been used in this project

  Retrofit 2 for API interaction

  Dagger 2 for dependency injection

  RxJava 2 for power of reactive programming
  
  Mockitto for Testing

I have used Dagger SubComponents to pass dependencies down in dependency graph.
