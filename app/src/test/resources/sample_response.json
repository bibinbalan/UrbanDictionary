They are particularly adept at training human beings to do their bidding, and spend 18 hours a day on average apparently sleeping.  What they are really doing is coming up with ways to take over the Earth while still retaining humans to make that yummy cat food for them.  If cats had opposable thumbs, they, not us, would be the dominant force on this planet.",

      "definition": "A cat is a furry creature, with claws. Can get annoyed if you stroke him/her too much. Cats can attack dogs, and cats are faster than dogs. Cats are the best hunters, no wonder, they have the best sense of smell, sight and hearing ever, and are really silent. They can run very fast, and if there was a dog after them, cats can do things dogs cant. A cat can climb trees, whereas dogs dont have claws that sharp. Cats know how to escape dogs, and sometimes even scare them off. To escape, they just walk on the fences, climb the trees until they are at their catflap. The dog is probably in the way, so the cat  launches himself/herself off the fence, jumps onto the dog, and into the catflap. Mine does anyway. To scare them off, cats have very sharp 'fangs', and their claws beat all! Cats have special moves in attacks, not just the boring old scratching and biting. Curl Up Move: The cat curls up, waiting for the dog to come. As soon as the dog is close, the cat is ready and starts shredding the dog up, scraping the dog with his/her feet, tearing the dog up with his/her front claws, also biting with the mouth and hissing.\r\nCombo Scratch: The cat jumps from the fence onto the dog, and starts using his/her claws to rip up the dog.\r\nThe Painful Move: The cat gets out his/her claws, leaps at the dog's face from some object like a fence, and claws the dog up. People think that bigger creatures are ALWAYS better, but its not true.",

She is the cutest you can get, and guess what? I got her for free. I found her in a tree, there was a bigger cat under the tree, dead, I guessed the corpse was her mother. I took her from the tree, and brought her home. She is so cute! Furry, warm, and when she sleeps, she leaves a lovely warm patch! Get her to sleep somewhere on your bed and once she wakes, theres a lovely warm patch waiting for you! She makes some of the cutest cat noises. She does sometimes use her claws and fangs.",
